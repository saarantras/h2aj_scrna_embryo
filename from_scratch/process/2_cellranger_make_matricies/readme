This script generates matricies containig expression counts of observations of each gene in each cell (commonly called a count matrix) from RNA sequencing data, which has been downloaded and re-arranged in previous steps.

Note that this was run three times, since the first time some of the samples were not appropriately processed due to a naming problem. The scripts are all identical, except that the second and third execution's array's were restricted to the ones that didn't work...

See reademe in previous step for more specifics on the naming confusion. The moral of the story is: cellranger is very particular about filenames.
