This workflow (IS INCOMPLETE) builds on the work of the following paper:

Xiang, L., Yin, Y., Zheng, Y. et al. A developmental landscape of 3D-cultured human pre-gastrulation embryos. Nature 577, 537â€“542 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1875-y

Specifically, it takes their human embryo scRNA-seq gene count matricies, filters and QCs them, and uses these data to examine H2AJ expression in early human development
